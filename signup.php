  <h2 id="admin">Administrators</h2>
  <b>How does the organization ensure safety?</b>
  <p>We design our science education program with safety in mind. All our chemicals are water based, and every member is trained to execute proper safety procedures.</p>
  <br>
  <b>Will Catalyst's STEM outreach program complement a school's existing science education system?</b>
  <p>Yes, our science education program is not just designed to 'WOW' and inspire an audience, but also to teach 'Next Generation' science standards in fields ranging from biology to computer science. Science is no longer an intimidating chapter in a textbook, but a tangible and inspiring experience.</p>
  <br>
  <b>How can Administrators organize a science education program with Catalyst?</b>
  <p>Follow the link at the top of the page to sign up for a show, or contact us by the listed phone and email. A different chapter will be assigned to your school depending on your location and availability.</p>
  <h2 id="sponsors">Sponsors</h2>
  <b>How can i donate right now?</b>
  <p><a href="donate.php">Click here</a> to see payment options. We will graciously accept any financial contribution.</p>
  <br>
  <b>Is Catalyst's program sustainable?</b>
  <p>Since our incorporation, we have modeled our organization with sustainability is mind. Investing heavily in research and development, seeking renewable funding sources, and operating through high school and university chapters that function with a business like culture of efficiency means that Catalyst has the ability to grow, advance, and adapt far into the future.</p>
  <br>
  <b>What expenses does the organization have?</b>
  <p>Our science education program requires modest expenditures for chemicals and materials required for both our magic shows and hands on science programs. Because we buy materials in bulk, we are able to get the most out of every dollar we receive. A cost analysis is available above.</p>
  <br>
  <b>Is Catalyst a 501(c)(3) public charity or a 501(c)(3) private foundation?</b>
  <p>Catalyst is a 501(c)(3) public charity. As a public charity, we conduct direct services to the community, and derive our funding and support primarily from the general public, receiving grants from individuals, government, and private foundations.</p>
  <br>
  <b>Will a grant or donation go toward paying salaries?</b>
  <p>No. Our members occupy volunteer positions in the organization, so they receive no financial compensation for their work.</p>
  <br>
  <b>How are funds managed?</b>
  <p>When funds are required for reimbursement or material purchases they are withdrawn from our bank account. All transactions are recorded.</p>
  <h2 id="members">Prospective Members</h2>
  <b>My school has a chapter, how do I join?</b>
  <p>Follow the link on the navigation bar to your chapter's website. There you can find the contact information of leaders who will be happy to welcome you to the Catalyst family.</p>
  <br>
  <b>Should I join even if science isn't my 'thing'?</b>
  <p>Yes, it doesn't take a genius. It takes a determined well rounded individual who is able to communicate effectively and respectfully. Our chapters also need artists, computer programmers, skilled writers, and graphic designers.</p>
  <br>
  <b>My school doesn't have a chapter, can I start one?</b>
  <p>Yes, yes you can! Starting a Catalyst chapter is a bit more involved than starting a usual club, but then, Catalyst is anything but usual!</p>
  <br>
  <b>My high school is in or near San Diego county:</b>
  <p>The first step is to contact a representative from the organization. We will visit your school to speak with your administrators about the program. If everything checks out, we will help you complete your club application forms and select and train an interim leadership team to get the chapter off to a solid start.</p>
  <br>
  <b>Anywhere else in the nation:</b>
  <p>Starting a chapter begins with completing a pre-establishment checklist. Obtain the checklist by contacting the organization.</p>
  <br>
  <b>My university is in or near San Diego county:</b>
  <p>Before establishing yourself on campus, get together a group of interested individuals and contact our organization. We will meet with you to discuss your first steps.</p>
  <br>
  <b>I'm inquisitive, I have more questions!</b>
  <p>Email us at info@catalyst4success.org with your inquiry.</p>
