<p class="c1"><span>11,516: And We&rsquo;re Just Getting Started</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>This week, Catalyst </span><span>performed </span><span>its last science magic show of the 2012-2013 school year. In just 4 months, the 32 high school members of Catalyst have reached 11,516 students across San Diego county. This accomplishment far exceeds our original goal of reaching 1000 kids.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The members of Catalyst would like to thank the administrators, advisors, and sponsors who have made this accomplishment possible. Specifically, the organization would like to thank Sundance Elementary principal Bob Rodrigo for believing in the team&#39;s mission and facilitating the first chemistry magic show. Looking back to that show, COO Cameron Ramos recalls, &quot;Despite not everything going as planned, that show was just the beginning of a rewarding experience. Since then, we have done so much to be proud of.&quot; The entire Catalyst team would like to also thank the members of the Catalyst Advisory Board: Todd Cassen, Dr. Collins, and Dr. Wu. The experience and advice these individuals have given to the organization has shaped the professional culture of Catalyst and motivates the team to exceed expectations. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>With much of this year&#39;s science education involving chemistry, the team has made it a priority to diversify Catalyst&#39;s science education program to include other sciences, engineering, and technology. Catalyst CEO Jason Ge stated that &ldquo;expanding our program to cover all the fields of STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) allows us to provide a comprehensive and diverse service to the students&rdquo;. These new additions will be made during the summer in preparation for the new school year. School administrators will now have the opportunity to customize a science education program with experiments and activities that augment their students&#39; education. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>This summer represents an opportunity for Catalyst to expand the scope and scale of next year&#39;s operations. Officers will take advantage of their time off from school to expand the Science Education Program to PUSD high schools. The motivation for expansion is tenfold. More affiliated high school chapters will allow Catalyst to reach more students,and also give chapter members the opportunity to develop new skills in public speaking, communications, and organization. Rancho Bernardo and Del Norte high school students who intend to work with the organization have already taken the first steps to start a chapter of Catalyst for Success. </span></p></body></html>
