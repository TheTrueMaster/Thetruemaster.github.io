On March 11, 2013, Catalyst for Success was officially recognized by the Poway Unified School Board. Four Catalyst members, Jason Ge, Erik Owen, Cameron Ramos, and Tina Quach, attended the board meeting and got a chance to speak with Westview principal Todd Cassen and other board members. After the principal&rsquo;s introduction, Jason spoke briefly about the organization and its accomplishments. He also showed the board a short video demo (which can also be found on Catalyst&rsquo;s youtube page). The group also showcased a few experiments (two exploding hydrogen balloons and one color change reaction). The performance was met with applause, even capturing the interest of student council members who stayed behind to watch the show.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After the presentation, Superintendent Collins spent a fair amount of time listing the accomplishments of Catalyst for Success, and explained how he first became aware of the organization after visiting its website. Dr. Collins admitted that he was surprised when he discovered the entire organization consisted of high school students. Cameron Ramos, Catalyst&rsquo;s Chief Communications Officer, mentioned, &quot;To know that our organization is being recognized after just a month of operations really lends credence to what we&rsquo;re doing. The recognition motivates us to continue helping children see science for what it really is: an incredibly rewarding search for an understanding as to how nature operates.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">About Catalyst for Success:</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education receives greater attention globally, Catalyst for Success aims to introduce the more captivating and interesting side of science to young students through chemistry &ldquo;magic&rdquo; shows, demonstrations of simple chemistry experiments pitched as magic.
