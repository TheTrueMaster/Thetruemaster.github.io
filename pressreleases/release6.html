Through numerous magic shows and hands-on after school programs, the student run Science Education Division of Catalyst has successfully exposed students across San Diego, in elementary, middle, and high school, to science on an incredible scale. The organization has performed for eight schools, including two Title 1, low income schools. At every performance, one aspect of Catalyst&rsquo;s shows has remained constant, every student in the audience is engaged and genuinely excited. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Also this week, Catalyst for Success </span><span class="c2">continued expansion of</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;the organization&rsquo;s after school science program to Meadowbrook Middle School. Jason Ge, Jacob Zemper, Tina Quach, and Jordan Ramos gave a presentation on the importance of STEM to over 100 middle school students before allowing the kids to try hands on experiments and ask questions about science competitions and STEM education opportunities in high school. I</span><span class="c2">n mid March, Tina Quach, Cameron Ramos, Jason Ge, Josh Shanes, and Jake Zemper facilitated the first program at Cherokee Point elementary in the disadvantaged North Park neighborhood east of Downtown San Diego.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Josh Shanes, Catalyst&rsquo;s Director of Fundraising, stated, &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">I loved it! I thought it was so much fun. The kids thought it was great to actually DO the experiments and I loved knowing that I made a large contribution to them feeling that way!&rdquo; Tina Quach, Vice President of Science Programs is currently working to expand our follow up program to more schools. Catalyst&rsquo;s after school activities are tailored for different age groups and are completely free for students and schools alike. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Expansion:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To keep up with the organization&rsquo;s growing commitment to the community, Catalyst&rsquo;s leadership has been hard at work planning and executing a large scale expansion of the non-profit. After reviewing hundreds of applications, Catalyst welcomed 17 new members to the organization in early April. This week, new members attended orientations to learn more about how Catalyst operates, and have already begun completing assignments and signing up to participate in upcoming events. Confident that new members will provide enough resources to accommodate an expansion of operations, Cameron Ramos and Jason Ge completed scheduling events for over 10,000 students by the end of May. Scheduling efforts are now being concentrated on year round schools and STEM related summer programs. The organization, working with the operations and technology departments, configured online financing to allow Catalyst to receive electronic donations. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">About Catalyst for Success:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">As STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education receives greater attention globally, Catalyst for Success aims to introduce the more captivating and interesting side of science to young students through chemistry &ldquo;magic&rdquo; shows, demonstrations of simple chemistry experiments pitched as magic.
