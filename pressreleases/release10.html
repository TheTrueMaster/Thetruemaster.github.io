Catalyst welcomes First County Official to Advisory Board - 9/13/13
<br><br>
This week, catalyst for success welcomes San Diego County Supervisor, Diane Jacob, to the organization as an honorary member of the advisory board.

Jacob's entrance to the board gives Catalyst more credence and the opportunity to partner with other public officials in spreading Catalyst's model to high schools across southern California. Dianne Jacob has had a long commitment to education. Having been re-elected to San Diego County Board of Supervisors for an historic sixth term in 2012, the San Diego State University alumna is proud to represent the more than 620,000 constituents who live in the dynamic Second District, including more than 270,000 unincorporated residents. The district is the largest of the five and covers more than 2,000 square miles. It includes all of the unincorporated communities in East County, including the Ramona and Julian areas, and the cities of El Cajon, La Mesa, Lemon Grove, Santee and Poway, and communities of Allied Gardens, College Area, Del Cerro, Grantville, Navajo, Rolando and San Carlos in the City of San Diego. Prior to her election to the Board of Supervisors, Dianne worked as a teacher in the East County, and was a member of the Jamul-Dulzura Union School District Board for 17 years. She was active in the California School Boards Association and served as its President in 1987.

Jacob's support for the organization has been longstanding. She first reached out to catalyst in early 2013 to offer her help in making STEM education more accessible for students in elementary and middle school.  This month, she sponsored a summit with local superintendents and district officials to spread Catalyst's sustainable and expandable model for STEM education throughout eastern San Diego county. CEO Jason Ge, Communications Associate Elizabeth Landau, and COO Cameron Ramos would like to extend their deepest thanks to Jacob and her staff on behalf of the entire Catalyst team for making the meeting a success.
