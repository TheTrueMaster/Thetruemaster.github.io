Two shows were performed, one for eighty fourth graders and another for eighty fifth graders. CEO Jason Ge introduced the organization by commenting on his achievements at the 44th International Chemistry Olympiad and explaining his first experiences with science and chemistry. Jason&rsquo;s mother inspired his interest in chemistry by showing him a simple experiment when he was young. Jason stated to the students that the by performing chemistry magic shows he hopes to &ldquo;give every student the same opportunity to be inspired by science as [he] was.&rdquo; After introducing the rest of the members who facilitated the show -- James Chang, Aseem Keyal, Elisa Lupin, Erik Owen, Cameron Ramos, and Mary Zhao -- the show began.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The performance opened with a &ldquo;bang&rdquo;! With Erik&rsquo;s assistance, volunteers from the audience exploded hydrogen balloons. For the next demonstration, another volunteer poured a clear solution into three separate beakers, resulting in solutions of red, white, and blue (the colors of the American flag). The next &nbsp;two experiment utilized oscillating reactions that caused solutions to change color. The students were divided into teams and encouraged</span><span class="c0 c5">&nbsp;to cheer for a color. Excited by the challenge, the students enthusiastically </span><span class="c0">did so as the two solutions transformed from gold to black and orange to brown, respectively. Next, a student caused a flammable paper cup to spontaneously ignite by &ldquo;thinking about fire.&rdquo; Finally, the performance ended with one more exploding hydrogen balloon. After the experiments, Jason revealed that there was no magic involved in these incredible demonstrations; it was all chemistry. He then explained the science behind each experiment.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">This first event was more successful than anyone could&rsquo;ve expected. The principal and teachers at the school loved it. Principal Bob Rodrigo stated, &quot;Your show engaged our students and staff from beginning to end...our students left your show motivated &nbsp;that they too could be great scientists!&rdquo; Mary Zhao, Catalyst&#39;s Director of Show Design, confirmed that the kids&rsquo; reactions were &ldquo;beyond our expectations&rdquo; and the kids &ldquo;enjoyed participating in the show. </span><span class="c0 c2">I felt like our work really paid off and it was a great start.&rdquo; </span></p></body></html>
